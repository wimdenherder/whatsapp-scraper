# scrape whatsapp conversations

it does not work yet. 
- click only on images that are not links (for ex youtube links)
- should wait for images to be loaded (how to detect? thumbnail image disappear and new big image shows up)
- scrape text as well
- in this text refer to image name (so that later you can insert the images back there)
- click and download video's
- grouped photos should work too
